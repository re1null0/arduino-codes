# Collection of code snippets for Arduino

## Description
The given collection is dedicated for all Arduino alike boards. In the following description, each folder will be described.
Feel free to (re)use the code in any way you wish, but bare in mind that the source code is provided "as-is". It is on your own risk and you are solely responsible for whatever happens then.

## How to set up? 

1. `Blink` is the introduction to the Arduino C++. The snippet fires LED13 to prove its workability.
2. `F7DKYIIHYZX8XQG` is used to transmit data via Bluetooth sensor HC05
3. `Getting_BPM_to_Monitor2` uses PulseSensor to depict heartbeat process
4. `SerialESP8266_library_test` is the simple check on ESP8266 sensor
5. `alcohol_neww` converts analog value of MQ-3 sensor to BAC
6. `arduino2ev3_bluetooth` code snippet allows user to connect Lego EV3 and Arduino microcontroller
7. `esp8266_telegram` connects ESP8266 with Telegram Messenger
8. `iot_patient` brings together PulseSensor with ESP8266 Wi-Fi sensor
9. `lm35` was used to measure room temperature using the LM35 sensor
